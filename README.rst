Minimal NES ca65 sprite example
===============================

A basic example which draws a square in the middle of the screen, and is moved
around by the controller.  Very Atari 2600!

This is also an example of how to read the controller.

To build the ROM:

* Install the cc65 toolchain: https://cc65.github.io/

* Make the ROM::

    make

The default path of the ROM is ``build/sprite.nes``.
